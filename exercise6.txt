Similar to exercise 5, I created a prgoram that takes the ciphertext and splits the ciphertext into 6 groups.
The groups are then represented in the dataset with each group being represented vertically.
In order to discover the correct permutation I looked at row 11 and made the word 'ground'.
this then solved the permutation order.
