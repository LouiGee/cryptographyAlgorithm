Using python I created a program that takes two parameters, the ciphertext and the shift.
the program then shifts each in the cipher text corresponding to the shift. 
In order to test each 25 potential shifts. The program was put in a for loop and then I manually checked the results to choose the correct shift - 15 in this case.
