I created a python program that Created 6 groups of 5 letters taking every 6th letter for each group. 
It Then counts the frequency of each letter in each group.
For example in group 1, W(17) is the joint most frequent letter in the ciphertext
Assuming E to be the most frequent character there are 18 spaces between E and W. +1 to account for E and the caeser shift is 19 = S.
For Group 2 the most common letter in the ciphertext is C(21). 
there are 24 spaces between E and C. +1 to account for E amd the ceaser shift is 25 = Y.
So on and so forth until the key is deciphered SYPPTJ. 
Then run the program from question 2 to dicipher.
